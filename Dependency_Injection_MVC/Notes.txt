Dependency Injection
=====================
Dependency Injection helps in injecting the dependent object in a class.

Types of Dependency Injection:
1.Constructor Injection  =>Most Popular
2.Property Injection
3.Method Injection

Issues without DI
====================
Tight coupling between the object as the dependent object is created within the class,
Also , The class in which these dependent object instances are created depend upon the
lifetime of this class and if GC collectes class memory then its dependent object are 
also collect the memory for there dependent object , though they may be shared in other
palces (ie :they are shared dependencies)

Advantages of DI
===================
1.Full disclosures of dependencies to client code
2.Addresses the single responsibility principle- relegation of all non-essential
  responsibilities to components outside the class
3.Loose coupling between dependent object and dependency
4.Giving up of control=>Inversion of control you just have to tust the injector like 
  Unity Framework etc.

Note : DI can be implemented without any DI Framework , but than it will be poor's man
       code of maninging all the these which can be delegated to a framework which is
	   time-tested



Unity Framework
==================
Unity is a dependency injection container from microsoft ,and it facilitate or take
the reponsibility of creating objects behind the sceens , So the class using these
objects have no idea about the creation of these dependent objects


Differnrent types of Dendency Injection container /IOC Containers
==================================================
1. Unity
2. NIject
3. Spring .NET
